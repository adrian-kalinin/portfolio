# Hey there!

My name is Adrian, and Iâ€™m a product-focused software engineer based in **Helsinki, Finland**.

## About me

I've got a solid background in **Python** and **Django**, creating and managing robust web applications. I'm all about writing clean, efficient, and scalable code that gets the job done.

Occasionally, I dive into the world of **JavaScript** and **Vue**, rolling up my sleeves to develop modern front-end applications as well.
